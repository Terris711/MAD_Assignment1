# MAD_Assignment1

Objective: The objective of this assignment is to build a feature-rich Tic-Tac-Toe game for
Android. By completing this assignment, students will demonstrate their understanding of
user interface design, event handling, game logic, and Android app architecture.
Tic-Tac-Toe game: Tic-Tac-Toe, also known as Noughts and Crosses or Xs and Os, is a classic
two-player game played on a square grid (typically played on a 3x3 grid). Two players take
turns, one using X markers and the other using O markers. Players place their markers in empty
cells of the grid. The first player to form a horizontal, vertical, or diagonal line of their markers
wins. If all cells are filled, and no player has formed a winning line, the game is a draw.
Tic-Tac-Toe is known for its simple rules and quick gameplay, making it a popular choice for
children and casual players. Despite its simplicity, the game has been studied for its
mathematical properties and strategic possibilities, especially in analysing optimal moves and
strategies to win or at least secure a draw. It's often one of the first games introduced to teach
game theory concepts, including dominance, strategy, and decision-making. Additionally, it
serves as a foundation for understanding more complex games and algorithms in the field of
artificial intelligence.
